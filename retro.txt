- PR reviews
  - squashing shouldn't be happening for addressing comments => can't see just the addressing update
  - convos should be resolved to see what's in progress of convo/addressing by the author of comment,
    not the PR author

- unclear "core" modules, what is old/new obsolote
  - where do we put common stuff like the BulletTickItemsAdapter ?
  - looks like we prefer duplicated code

- bugs written in hard to follow way (324074, it expects me to know the app/usecase well)
- analytics, sometimes confusing specs (c&p issues?)

- jira in citrix is just super pain
  - no clipboard
  - preview of attached stuff is shit
  - uploading video crashlog is just, OMG!
  
? - multiple loadings in VM is bad imo
  - changing visibility of multiple buttons is just bad UX/a11y 
    - case of no buttons visible uncovered (not sure if possible by backend logic)
  - code grows quite quckly into sealed classes loading/loaded 
  - proper handling of app ui state loading/loaded if navigating back
  - hammering backend just because of structure of interactors
