What didn't go well
- testing of stories for the maintenance dialog
  - TicketA/StoryA failed because of missing stuff from TicketB
  - TicketB/StoryB blocked because TicketA can't finish

- few bugs created with testing strange build numbers due to overlaping test cases
  
- communitacing with QA is hard, 
  - they say half story because they expect mind reading

- PRs are way too poluted by formatting and unimportant stuff (format etc)

- Parkrun, too many bugs which looked like it wasn't implemented at all

- way too many bugs related to changing a word in texts etc

- leak canary is just super annoying

-----------------------------------
+ spectrum refactoring/cleanup

- confusing specs, different keywords/names for same thing (health coach <=> wellbeing, etc)
- tickets without BDD tests
- ticket(s) being blocked if some other feature as another navigation origin not implemented
  - scaffolding worked
  - should've raised an issue to scaffold screen for the navigation  
- unclear PR flow 
  - story (unprotected) => subtask doesn't need 2 approvals
  - should be story PR just blind ? => - which PR is the for the review ?

- can we update the PR template to use JIRA link ?
  - automatic link via branch name ?
- clean/turn off warnings, very hard to see what's the issue if the log is polluted by warnings 

- what's difference between jira ticket state PRCreated/InReview ?

-------------------------------------------
- jira in citrix is just super pain
  - no clipboard
  - preview of attached stuff is shit
  - uploading video crashlog is just, OMG!
  - citrix is stubborn last 2 days
  
  
- PR reviews
  - squashing shouldn't be happening for addressing comments => can't see just the addressing update
  - convos should be resolved to see what's in progress of convo/addressing by the author of comment,
    not the PR author

- unclear "core" modules, what is old/new obsolote
  - where do we put common stuff like the BulletTickItemsAdapter ?
  - looks like we prefer duplicated code

- bugs written in hard to follow way (324074, it expects me to know the app/usecase well)
- analytics, sometimes confusing specs (c&p issues?)
  
? - multiple loadings in VM is bad imo
  - changing visibility of multiple buttons is just bad UX/a11y 
    - case of no buttons visible uncovered (not sure if possible by backend logic)
  - code grows quite quckly into sealed classes loading/loaded 
  - proper handling of app ui state loading/loaded if navigating back
  - hammering backend just because of structure of interactors
